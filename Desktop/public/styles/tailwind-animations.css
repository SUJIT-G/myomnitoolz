/* This file is intentionally left empty or can be deleted. 
   The original index.tsx tried to import it, but custom animations with Tailwind CDN 
   are typically handled differently (e.g., in <style> tags in index.html or via config if using PostCSS).
   Since the prompt specifies ONLY Tailwind CSS and no separate CSS files for components, 
   this file is being effectively removed by not being generated or by being empty.
   The error fix for constants.ts is unrelated to this file, but addressing it correctly.
